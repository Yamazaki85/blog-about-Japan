      <p>
        1. Visit during cherry blossom season You might be surprised to learn
        that the glorious cherry blossom, seen adorning postcards and tourist
        brochures from across Japan, actually only blooms in the country during
        sakura (cherry blossom) season. Running roughly from the end of March to
        early May, it can be the most expensive time to visit, but it’s also
        when Japan is at its most enchanting and vibrant. Sakura is so prized
        that there’s even a word for enjoying looking at it (and other flowers):
        hanami. Walking through parks, you’ll notice crowds gathered for hanami
        parties, picnicking under trees.

        <br />
        2. There’s no need to tip In fact, it can be seen as rude, and if you do
        tip, you may find yourself being chased by a waiter, thinking you've
        left your change by mistake. An alternative, if you take a guided tour
        or cookery class for example, is to bring a small present from your
        country as a token of your appreciation.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Be polite Foreigners have a reputation for being noisy in Japan,
        especially on public transport, so be respectful; it’s impolite to
        answer your phone, and, if you’re listening to music, turn the volume
        down low. It’s ruder in Japan to blow your nose in public than sniff,
        and avoid eating on the go.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bring cash 4. It can prove fairly difficult to find ATMs in Japan, so
        it’s a good idea to exchange money before you go, or to take reasonably
        large amounts out at a time. When you do need to take more out, head to
        a post office, or to a 7-Eleven or Citibank ATM.

        5.Make use of Konbinis Konbinis, or convenience stores, tend to have
        many of the things that visitors will need, as well as delicious steamed
        buns. Familymart, 7-Eleven and Lawson are the big names, and you’ll find
        them everywhere you go.
